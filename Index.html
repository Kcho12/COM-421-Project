<section id="Causes">
<h2>What is the cause?</h2>
	<p class="intro_paragraph"> The cause is Greenhouse gases which are released by:</p>
		<ul>
		<li><p>Burning fossil fuel</p></li>
		<li><p>Deforestation</p></li>
		<li><p>Land-use change</p></li>
		</ul>
	<p> Greenhouse gases prevent heat from leaving Earth's atmosphere. Without greenhouse gases, Earth would not be warm enough to sustain life. Right now, we have too much of these green house gases due to increased human industrial activity within the last century. As a result, the changes in the global temperature are causing negative changes in our climate. </p>
